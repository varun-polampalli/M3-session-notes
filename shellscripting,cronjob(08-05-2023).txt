Steps to Write a Shell Script :

Step 1 : Create a file with .sh Extenstion.

Syntax : touch File.sh

vi file.sh : it will open Terminal 

i : To insert the data(change mode)

To save : esc shift + :wq

Example :

ls 

pwd

2nd Example :
------------------
nano date.sh

#!/bin/bash ( Just to indict we are using bash shell)

date >> output.txt

------------------------------------------------------
I want to execute the same file each and every minute 

To Execute that we need to apply the cronjobs .

Cronjobs :
----------------
Cronjobs are used to Schedule the jobs .

To Perform the Routine tasks we need to Shedule the jobs.

Backups and Logs.

To Configure the cronjobs :
--------------------------------
Step 1 : Edit the crontab file

crontab -e 

syntax : * * * * * /file-path

1st * : Minutes
2nd * : Hours
3rd * : Date
4th * : Month of the year
5th * : Day of the week

Example : * * * * * /root/date.sh

Step 2 : We need to provide the execution Permission to date.sh file.

chmod 777 date.sh

Step 3 : We display the cronjobs 

crontab -l

Step 4 : To Display the output 

tail -f output.txt

To Exit ctrl+c

Each and every 2min i want to excute the file
----------------------------------------
step 1 : 

nano cron.sh

#!/bin/bash

date >> date.txt

Step 2 :
------------------
crontab -e 

*/2 * * * * /root/cron.sh

Step 3 : To check the cronjobs 

crontab -l

Step 4 : Provide a Execution permission to cron.sh file 

chmod 777 cron.sh

Step 5 : tail -f date.txt

Assignment :
